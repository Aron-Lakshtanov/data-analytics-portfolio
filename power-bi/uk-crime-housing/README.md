# UK Crime & Housing Analysis (Power BI)

**Tools:** Power BI, SQL, Excel  
**Goal:** Help users compare areas based on crime levels and housing affordability to support location-based decisions.

## What I did
- Collected and combined multiple public datasets (police crime data, housing prices, population).
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query and SQL.
- Built a data model with measures such as crimes per 1,000 residents and year-on-year changes.
- Designed an interactive Power BI report for non-technical stakeholders to explore risk and affordability by area.

## Key Insights (examples)
- Certain areas show high crime per 1,000 residents despite average property prices.
- There are clear regional patterns where lower crime is associated with higher average prices.
- Stakeholders can filter by region and year to see how crime trends and prices move together.
