# [Streaming Analytics Dashboard] (Tableau)

**Tools:** Tableau, [SQL/Excel/etc.]  
**Goal:** [Briefly describe the business question – e.g. analyse viewer behaviour, content performance and engagement over time.]

## What I did
- Collected and prepared data from [data sources – e.g. platform exports, CSVs, SQL database].
- Cleaned and reshaped the data for analysis (handling missing values, creating calculated fields, normalising metrics).
- Built interactive Tableau dashboards showing [e.g. trends in views, watch time, follower growth, and top-performing content].
- Added filters and parameters so stakeholders can explore performance by [e.g. date range, content type, region].

## Key Insights (examples)
- [Example insight 1 – e.g. prime viewing periods or content categories that drive most engagement.]
- [Example insight 2.]
- [Example insight 3.]
